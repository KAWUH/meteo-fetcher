# meteo-fetcher

A simple and lightweight CLI tool that fetches data from Open-Meteo.com and generates an HTML file containing said data presented in a chart.
Currently it's temperature and pressure only.

The only edit you have to do is change the latitude and longitude values so that the weather data is accurate to your location,
I think I'll add a config file of some sort in the future to simplify this process and add more options to what data you fetch from Open-Meteo.
