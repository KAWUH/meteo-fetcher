# meteo-fetcher

A simple and lightweight CLI tool that fetches data from OpenMeteo.com and prints it out as text.
Currently it's temperature and pressure only.

The only edit you have to do is change the latitude and longitude values so that the weather data is accurate to your location,
I think I'll add a config file of some sort in the future to simplify this process and add more options to what data you fetch from OpenMeteo.
